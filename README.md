# Instagram-Likes-Analysis
**Data**The data for my research was taken from my personal Instagram account. The question I intended to analyze was, does my Instagram feed truly disrupt my emotional state? A large portion of the general public can be convinced that social media apps like Instagram do infact change our youth by giving them access to post that can change one's emotional state. To answer this question I gathered the number of likes and followers aswell as recording the emotion that was elicated by each individual Instagram post. The emotions I recorded were uplifting, envious, funny, motivated, and desensitized. 
**Operationalization**To meticulously analyze the emotional and stylistic qualities inherent in each Instagram post, I developed a comprehensive qualitative coding scheme. This scheme aimed to capture the subjective nuances of user experiences by quantifying the concept of emotional resonance through a binary coding system. A score of 1 indicated a palpable shift in emotional state induced by the post, while a score of 0 denoted a lack thereof. This methodological approach facilitated a nuanced exploration of emotional engagement within the digital realm. The tracking and recording of the feelings evoked by each Instagram post directly aligned with the concept of emotional response to social media, providing valuable insights into user interactions and perceptions.
Furthermore, in operationalizing the specifics of an Instagram page, I sought to gauge the popularity of these accounts and explore potential connections between popularity and specific emotions. To achieve this, I meticulously tracked the follower count and likes of each individual post. Follower count ranged from 0 to 1,000,000+, mirroring the varying degrees of influence and reach exhibited by different accounts. Similarly, likes followed the same numerical trend, serving as indicators of user engagement and affinity. By quantifying these metrics, I aimed to uncover patterns and correlations between popularity metrics and emotional responses, shedding light on the complex dynamics shaping user interactions and perceptions within the Instagram ecosystem.
